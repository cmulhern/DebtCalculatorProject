A small web app to calculate how long it will take to payoff a number of debts as well as how much total interest will be paid. This project was primarily meant as a way to partice with jquery, various jquery plugins, and AJAX. 

Some features I focused on:
-AJAX submissions
-The form is dynamic (rows can be added and deleted by the user; currently no row limit)
-Using jquery to disable delete button if there is only one row
-Using jquery to disable submit button if any fields (excluding name fields) are empty
